<div><blockquote>The solar physicists cared just as much as the official climatologists, about keeping the world safe for their grandchildren.  <span style="background-color:yellow">They said it was rash to suppose that every possible variation in the Sun's output of light had been seen by the satellites in the course of a single solar cycle.  The solar-terrestrial physicists, for their part, pleaded for consideration of other ways in which the Sun might affect the Earth via the solar wind -- auroras, that sort of thing</span>.

The role of the Sun had to be minimized.  The commentary concentrated entirely on changes in the output of radiant energy from the visible disk.  <span style="background-color:yellow">As for the invisible heliosphere that embraced the Earth in the solar wind, and might contain other possible ways of changing the climate, for Houghton's group it did not exist. - p41-42</span></blockquote></div>
