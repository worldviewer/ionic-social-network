## Defining the Problem of Modern Scientific Discourse

</p>

Our traditional system of lectures and problem sets imprints upon most university graduates today a "positivist" approach to scientific discourse and education, which positions scientific communications as a uni-directional flow of information from experts to laypeople.  Many professional scientists today come away from the graduate programs' intensive emphasis upon memorization with a worldview which is observably detrimental to the process of scientific investigation.  It tends to take the assumptions of models for granted, and essentially treats the models as reality.  From that perspective, the underlying motives of scientific researchers can observably shift from investigation towards eliciting a particular aligning belief within the minds of laypeople.  For many topics today which will not experience any significant revision over many centuries, this approach can actually create efficient problem solvers.

By sharp contrast, a number of universities have more contemporary physics education research (PER) programs today which emphasize a "constructivist" approach to science education and discourse.  In these programs, the focus is not so much upon truth, established science, memorization of exemplars, and conclusions; but rather upon the asking of good questions, the mapping out of debate, the resolution of scientific controversies, the quality of the conversation, adherence to scientific values, creative problem-solving and effective re-framing in the face of stubborn (aka "wicked") problems.  The underlying idea is that even though the philosophers are oftentimes correct that there is indeed one single truth, scientific investigators should nevertheless approach the more stubborn problems of science with a many-perspectives worldview.  This subtle distinction between philosophy of science and science education approaches has spilled much ink over the years, but it is truthfully not a complicated issue.

The dichotomy between positivism and constructivism (two words which admittedly arrive with significant baggage) is arguably best explained by the education researcher and inventor of concept maps, Joseph Novak.  He positions it as essentially the difference between "thinking what scientists think" (positivism) and "thinking like a scientist" (constructivism).  Although philosophers of science and physics education researchers have (venomously) debated these subjects for decades now, nearly everybody who is today university-educated was taught with a positivist worldview to *think what scientists think*.

This decision lends some stability to scientific theory, which can be argued to have some certain *systemic* (in other words, economic) advantages, and Jeff Schmidt argues that it also permits the formulation of teams of large scientists with "assignable curiosity" (Jeff Schmidt's term, from _Disciplined Minds_).  Education theorist, John Taylor Gatto, has implicated this approach to education as the very cause for the advance of technology.

However, this approach comes with some costly side-effects -- namely that:

</p>

* Graduate students never actually learn of alternatives to their textbook theories which originate from alternative scientific frameworks, and this lack of awareness can severely affect their inferential skills.  There are numerous instances observable online today where academic researchers and graduate students are actually the last to know of certain scientific controversies.

</p>

* The focus upon problem-solving, to the detriment of a more concepts-first approach, undermines critical thinking insofar as it complicates an individual's ability to back out of an idea.  In order to question something, a person must be able to see the larger structure which contains it, *and to do so as they are learning it*.  In other words, they must be fluent in the larger sea of ideas which compete with it, which may even differ at the level of concepts and definitions.

</p>

* If there are any mistakes in this dominant scientific framework, then we should expect with a positivist approach that the entire community of scientists will collectively and righteously dismiss ideas which will may one day turn out to be recognized as superior to those currently taught.  Eventually, and predictably, these models will bear all of their lower-hanging fruit, and scientific discovery will then expensively derive more from tinkering and observation than from the theory itself.  This situation has been described by Neil Stephenson as <a href="http://www.wired.com/2011/10/stephenson-innovation-starvation/">"innovation starvation"</a>.

</p>

* It should not be assumed that students knowledgeable in the dominant framework are skilled in the tacit ability to re-frame on stubborn problems.  It seems apparent that re-framing is a widespread problem amongst academics and laypeople alike.  Amongst CEO's, it is a highly valued skill that can make the difference between success and failure of a company; the scientific endeavor is probably no different.  The re-framing skill does not simply emerge from memorization of exemplars; it more likely evolves as a consequence of making crucial, rational decisions in an environment where there are lots of competing ideas (like in the sort of challenging case studies that Harvard business graduates must endure).  The existing graduate programs do not appear to train this soft skill, which should be alarming to people when it comes to important controversies like climate change.

</p>

* The dominant scientific framework's preference for certain sides of scientific controversies over others can create <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ChrisReeveOnlineScientificDiscourseIsBroken/posts/9MHHCUY38Cz">a special type of ignorance within even experts</a>.  These blind spots are not simply lacking in thought.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgQutgSwY88">Daniel Kahneman</a> has shown that the mind is really two systems -- a slow rational System 2, and a far faster emotion-based, pattern-matching system known as System 1 -- and that where System 2 creates ignorance, System 1 will flourish.  This complex sequence of events tends to occur most often today as a reaction to information overload.  This plainly suggests that academia's decision to ignore against-the-maintream ideas and certain sides of controversies leads them to have irrational thoughts about the other sides of those arguments.  This is a problem faced by everybody, as System 1 is responsible for keeping people alive.

</p>

* The refusal to fully and meaningfully engage both sides of scientific controversies creates what I like to call "innovation bottlenecks".  As a methodology, such an approach assumes that it knows the answer to a big question when in fact the community of scientists have collectively decided not to rationally engage the other side of the issue.  Such an approach can be expected to be extremely costly to society's future standard of living insofar as these controversies can be expected to basically block certain scientific discoveries.

## A Prototype for a Solution: A Mobile Gesture-Based Scientific Article Reader that Teaches Epistemology, Worldviews, History and Philosophy of Science through Use of the App

My name is Chris Reeve and I've spent a decade closely following the issues faced by a group of scientific theorists who have been engaged in a bitter dispute for more than half a century.  The two sides of this debate publish in two different scientific journals -- the _Astrophysical Journal_ and IEEE's _Transactions on Plasma Science_.  I've used this highly complex debate over how to model the universe's fundamental state for matter, *plasma*, as a prototypical controversy to design a solution.  My approach contrasts sharply with <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ChrisReeveOnlineScientificDiscourseIsBroken/posts/ZyWHQxTUk53">Google's approach for their truth engine</a>, where they test their system with the debate over Obama's birth certificate.

</p>

The design of the Worldviewer app below is based upon this decade of observation, and about four years of contemplating a design.  I consider this app to be a prototype, and I hope to use it to advance my design to the next stage: A graphical interface on both the mobile and desktop platforms.

## The MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/worldviewer/ionic-social-network/blob/master/www/img/readme/swipe-diagram.jpg" />
</p>

### Separated, But Weakly-Interacting, Levels of Scientific Discourse

Different people engage scientific theory for different reasons.  Traditionally, all of them have essentially been forced into the same virtual "room", where they predictably clash.  The scientific explorer who is seeking out good questions and entertaining novel hypotheses will in this traditional landscape be forced to directly speak with the modeler who is more focused upon quantifying their preferred model.  The problem is that these two distinct groups exhibit different values for the scope of their investigation.  And these values can over time change as a reaction to their objectives.  We are all on different parts of the same journey.  This strongly suggests that we need some amount of separation to facilitate these groups working as one cohesive organism towards their larger common objective -- just as the organs of a body exhibit both separation and communication with one another.

The basic idea with the worldviewer app is that there are 3 fundamental types of conversations which we need to have for every scientific press release or paper, in order to become better scientific thinkers:

- Propositional
- Model-based
- Clash of worldviews

These three types of conversations collectively compose **rational** scientific discourse, and are fundamentally differentiated by the user's underlying objective.  In the typical online interaction, it is usually the case that a person will tend to prioritize one of these goals over the others.  Although this is not ideal within the scope of that particular individual, it is nevertheless okay when our communication platform effectively links those thinkers up with each other.

Within the scope of a particular article or paper event, any set of conversations where one of these objectives/layers is completely missing can be characterized as an "incomplete" dialog insofar as it favors certain objectives over others.  Implicit in my app is the philosophy that when scientific conversation is "well-rounded", the participants come away with a more useful perspective on the claims.

The gist of my intention here, in part, is to normalize the clash-of-worldviews aspect of discourse -- a fundamental tenent of the "constructivist" science education approach which focuses upon the *quality* of scientific discourse rather than the conclusions -- a necessary approach, in particular, for the discussion of scientific controversies, which will be a focus for this system.  These concepts of "incomplete" and "well-rounded" discourse are generally more useful constructs for science that is in some way contested.

### The Conceptual Level of Discourse

(Due to implementation complexity, most of this level will not make it into the MVP.)

The mobile app will encode this epistemological hierarchy with swipe gestures: From the central locus of the article (the main view), swiping left or right from this article takes the reader to an annotated view or a map of the key concepts for that article (which would eventually link into a much larger graph of concepts).  So, this first level is the **concept and resource (article) view**.

### The Propositional Level of Discourse (aka the Adjacent Possible)

Swiping up from the article takes the user to the **propositional view**, where questions are asked, and where people strive to become better critical thinkers.  This view is fundamentally *divergent* in that it is a place where people seek to diverge from the claims of the article content.  The search box at this level specifically searches on scientific questions.

### The Model Level of Discourse

One more swipe up takes the person to the **model view**, which by contrast is fundamentally *convergent*.  *The model-level view importantly provides a consistent, fast interface to models*.  This page is created -- with the help of experts -- by the administrators.  The point is to create a consistent, searchable interface for ideas which is inclusive of against-the-mainstream ideas.

### The Worldview Level of Discourse 

Yet another swipe up takes them to the **clash of worldviews** over the article's claims/observations, from competing worldviews.  Both convergence and divergence are visible from this level, insofar as the nodes can branch off to questions or models.  There is a search feature at this level which specifically searches on scientific controversies.  Each controversy is represented by a tag, and can encompass numerous nodes.

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://plus.google.com/108466508041843226480/posts/Q12YRp5rwFP"><img src="https://github.com/worldviewer/ionic-social-network/blob/master/www/img/readme/kahneman-two-systems-of-the-mind.jpg" /></a>
</p>

Swiping down from the original article takes the user to the **believable narratives**, aka "associative coherence".  This would logically place this lower-level system of pattern-matching beneath System 2, and the article would symbolically rest between these two systems of the mind.  A search box brings up particular instances of associative coherence.

Swiping down yet further takes them to **other similar articles** -- a mix of related resources voted on by users, but also suggested by the system (via topic modeling/mapping) and hand-populated by administrators.  The user can continue to swipe downwards many levels to retrieve yet more related articles.

*The core of this idea is to induce people to visualize the inherent structure of science within their heads* -- an idea which sources from physics education researcher <a href="https://www.narst.org/publications/research/Metacogn.cfm">Bob Gowan</a>.  Direct shortcuts to these epistemological layers will not be provided, in order to ensure that this hierarchy is imprinted upon the user's memory; what will be provided is ready access to the diagram, which users can use to facilitate cognitively visualizing the app's navigation.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/worldviewer/ionic-social-network/blob/master/www/img/readme/structure-of-science.jpg" /></a>
</p>

It's become apparent through years of interactions with people online about scientific controversies that this structure to scientific theory is widely misunderstood by both laypeople and scientists alike.  The clue which gives it away is that although most people *do* have some understanding of what concepts, propositions and models are, very few people understand what a worldview is, or the role of worldviews in shaping focus questions.  This failure to understand that there are competing worldviews within the sciences exhibits an enormous effect upon the rate of innovation within the sciences, as it shapes the way we communicate science.

The interface will enforce as a matter of habit these different aspects of *thinking like a scientist*.  Most importantly, by observing the relationship of the article or paper to the content in each of these levels, the users will learn what a **worldview** is.  This failure to understand what a scientific worldview is is a very serious problem that has plagued modern scientific discourse.

Beyond that, this seems to me an excellent way to break up the various ways we can talk about some resource into their unique spaces, insofar as it creates a separation of concerns for scientific discourse which nevertheless weakly interact.  Later, as I become more knowledgeable about graphics, I can stick with this infrastructure, and simply upgrade the pages, one at a time.

For now, what I can do is create the more mundane social networking aspects associated with this app -- namely, the data models (the users, articles, ratings, and annotation library) -- and also whatever social network infrastructure I need to mix in to engage the users (profile pages, whatever).  And I can create an API to interface this app which can be reused later for any more traditional desktop interface.  In other words, both the mobile app and the desktop app would use the same data source.

It's becoming apparent that figuring out how to implement a graphical user interface for this app is going to take me a long time, and may require the assistance of a UX designer.  I might actually need to switch to a more native platform to pull that off.  But, what I can do right now is fill in the parts which involve no graphics at all, so that I can create a prototype which I can then use for getting feedback.

## Other MVP Features

1. The ranking of comments at each level is guided by a system of values which pertain to that specific scope (system 1, propositional, model, worldview).  Each level will differ with regards to this set of values.

2. Users comments at the model level are expected to adhere to the worldview within which that model exists.  The community of users has the option of defining the values associated with a particular worldview (in other words, the principles that guide the refinement of a particular model).

3. The values associated with the worldview and propositional views are fixed by the admininstrator.

4. The annotation library must support both images and text.

5. Questions raised at the propositional level might, for instance, point out a mismatch between conventional theory and some observation; when a user clicks on such a question, it takes them to a route at the worldview level specifically intended to accumulate information on this specific question.  From that worldview route, there can be further links to various models which claim to answer this collected body of evidence.  This is clearly a graph database.  These links to models can be ranked according to how well they explain the observations.

6. Tags can be applied at each level by simply clicking a tag button, and then touching one or more words within the content.  Or, it can be typed in.  Either way, the system will first check to see if this tag exists before saving a new one.

7. Since questions can originate from a particular worldview, questions can be tagged as well.

8. Users should have site currency that can be granted on an individual basis by site administrators for poignant contributions.  This site currency might, for instance, initially elevate a user's comment to the top of the stack until/unless it is overcome by the level's ratings.  *Currency would be rewarded on completely different bases, depending upon the level in which it is granted*.

9. There should be different types of transgressions which people can level at one another, and then the collective can rate as to their validity. The most basic and serious transgressions should pertain to the failure to conform to effective dialog. Commenting on an idea without following the link would fall into this category, but so would blatantly misrepresenting a model.  Another transgression would be to judge a worldview simply because it deviates from the established one.

10. Allow users to retitle the article at either the worldview or model layers ... "Article should be titled:"

11. One of the criteria by which propositional suggestions might be judged is by how creative the question is (the "re-framing" criteria).

12. Profile pages should permit a person to explain their worldview.

13. System would include a short animated tutorial which explains the theory behind the approach, prominently displayed as button at bottom of homepage.

14. Nodes at the worldview level could support the suggestion of experiments to try to settle a question.

15. Rebuttals should always be rated in terms of whether or not they respond to the highlighted claim.

16. The model-level view should include lots of information about how to create models + information on probability/statistics + discussions about mathematics for that particular domain.

17. There must be a way for people to post content from other articles by just copying and pasting, preferably parsing the content and applying our own formatting to this content.

18. There should be an annotation library for associative coherence.

19. Include templates for the propositional and worldview layers, such as "This is a speculative claim that derives from ..."; "This completely ignores ..."; etc.

20. Use certain highlighters and text colors to mean various things, so this will involve the introduction of a suite of highlighters (if possible).

21. Include a series of presentational annotations within the library (like TLDR) which give advice on how to craft a succinct, persuasive argument.

22. Use tags also (at least initially) to represent annotations from the annotation library.

## Post-MVP Features

1. When the context exhibits a significant match with a former article, the discussion associated with that former article will seed the current discussion.

2. Concept mapping with XML (aka topic mapping) will not be implemented until post-MVP, and it may even lag the actual creation of a topic insofar as it could require a cron job.

3. Deep zoom will **not** be a part of the MVP.

4. Users need some sort of a system for quantifying the risk of learning a new idea -- perhaps a formula that divides amount of effort to understand by the amount of information available on the idea, etc.

5. Include a marketplace at the model layer where very specific advertising is permitted with regards to the maker community, scientific gear, etc.  These advertisers will all be hand-picked.

6.  When a person enters a scientific question, it should perform typeahead on the basis of all former questions.

## Technology Decisions

There are three fundamental design decisions driving my choice of technologies:

1. **Rapid prototyping**: The point of this project is to create an MVP which I can then use to procure additional feedback.  I only have a single week to create the project, so the tool must support the creation of this large set of functionality within this limited timeframe.  This is why I have chosen the **Ionic Framework**.  It's expected that the final app will be more graphical, and might accordingly require a more native programming language like Swift or Objective-C.

2. **Graph database**: The dataset clearly dictates a graph-like structure connecting data of differing types: particularly concepts, propositions, models and worldviews.  This is a classical **graph database** design, which will prove to be a challenge as I've never worked with one before.

3. **Readable codebase**: It's very important to me that my codebase remain legible as it grows, as I'll be working on this project over the course of many years.  **Angular**'s directives and separation of concerns are an ideal fit for such a need.  I intend to keep the code very well commented so that others can be brought into the project very rapidly.

## User Narratives

### Goal: The Quickie Model Search

Adam has just heard from somebody online of a scientific theory he's never been exposed to before: *electric joule heating*.  It came up in an informal debate on a forum.  Adam has for many years followed what he perceives as the dire situation of climate change, but under the impression that there were no other possible explanations.  He's read it stated many times by professional scientists and science journalists that the Sun cannot possibly be responsible for changes to the planet's temperature, and he takes these professionally-trained scientists at their word since he's not been trained as a scientist himself.

Adam did a Google search on "electric joule heating", and there weren't a lot of search hits like with other climate change topics.  He also noticed that of the ones that ame up, they were highly technical and somewhat scattered over a dozen websites.  He started to feel a bit anxious that maybe this wasn't really all that important, and that he should perhaps get back to the work he was *supposed* to be doing.  He really just wanted a quick explanation of what it was; he wasn't looking to take on a lengthy investigation.

Adam goes to http://thepeer.reviews and he sees the following screen:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/worldviewer/ionic-social-network/blob/master/www/img/readme/ionic-creator-homepage.jpg" />
</p>

He enters "electric joule heating" and clicks on the third link for search.  The page changes to a profile of the concept.  This second page is sort of reminiscent of other social networking interfaces which portray people, except that it's about a scientific model.

At the top of the screen is this brief explanation:

> Description: Electric joule heating proposes that the Earth can be 
> electrically heated by the flow of charged particles coming from the Sun and 
> other cosmic phenomena.  Conventional theory models this flow of charged 
> particles fundamentally as a fluid, but these models have been in dispute 
> since their inception.  One alternative hypothesis likens these moving 
> charges to an electric current.  Advocates point to the fact that the solar 
> wind is oftentimes guided by planetary magnetic fields into the poles, and 
> the presence of hot spots at these poles for a number of planets within our 
> solar system is suggestive of the idea that this flow of charged particles
> can heat up the planets it is guided into.
>
> Status: Electric joule heating is not widely known, and much of the data 
> necessary to judge the idea has yet to be taken.  No known experiments or 
> observational satellites are currently planned to test it.  The concept is

The next time that Adam sees a scientific press release talk about melting ice at the poles, he remembers back to those hot spots on other planets.

### Goal: The Speed of Gravity

Alex is a fan of science documentaries and science journalism sites like space.com.  He was talking to somebody online, and overheard an unusual claim that he couldn't reconcile with anything he had ever learned about Einstein's Relativity: He heard that if the speed of gravity was the speed of light, then simulations had demonstrated that the solar system could not possibly hold itself together.  He reasoned that it has to be untrue because he would have already heard of the claim in one of the shows he regularly watches.  This person must be a crackpot pushing some pet theory, so he went to http://thepeer.reviews/
